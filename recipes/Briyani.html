        <li><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Biryani in India doesn't just mean biryani. There are variations across the length and breadth of the country.</p>
            <p>There is Hyderabadi biryani (which is what I'm sharing today) where the biryani has a lot of gravy or masala and is cooked slowly with rice in a sealed pot.</p> 
            <p>Then there is the Muslim wedding biryani which actually has lesser masala, but packed with flavour mostly from whole spices; the Kerala biryani, donne biryani from Karnataka and so many more.</p>
